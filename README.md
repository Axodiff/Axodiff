- 👋 Hi, I’m @Axodiff
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, foreign languages and chess 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code xD 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something that would teach me more about coding in C++ mostly
- 📫 How to reach me I don't really now... I'll figure it out ^^
- 😄 Pronouns: He, Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't know anything in coding, but I think it should be good to begin somewhere.
